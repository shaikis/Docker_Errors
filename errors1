Docker failed with the error: Error response from daemon: error creating overlay mount to invalid argument

// the fix is to edit /etc/docker/daemon.json file and add below content to it:

{ "storage-driver": "devicemapper" }
 

Reload the systemctl daemon:

systemctl daemon-reload
And restart docker service:

systemctl restart docker
